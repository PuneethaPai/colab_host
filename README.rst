Host any (python) application in colab or kaggle notebook environment
---------------------------------------------------------------------

Google Colab and Kaggle notebook environments are great. You have powerful compute, but just using their notebook environment feels restrictive.
Given the hardware you should be able to do more.


Inspired from `Abhishek Thakur <https://github.com/abhishekkrthakur/>`_, and his work on `colab code <https://github.com/abhishekkrthakur/colabcode>`_ this package extends the idea.
